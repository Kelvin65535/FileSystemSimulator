# FileSystemSimulator
A simple file management system simulater including a disk file and independent GUI. Using C# and Windows Form to develop.

This system has a binary file to simulate a 8MB disk, which a byte of the file corresponds an actural byte in a disk. The virtual disk includes a simple FAT-like file system. It means you can create a real folder or a file on this system just like Windows and Linux. --But you can't run an executable program on it because it just a file system simulator not a operating system simulator.
