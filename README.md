# FileSystemSimulator
A simple file management system simulater including a disk file and built-in GUI. 

Using C#, .Net FrameWork 4.6 and Windows Form to develop. You can import this project into Visual Studio or double-click the binary release to run it.

This system has a binary file to simulate a 8MB disk, which a byte of the file corresponds an actural byte in a disk. The virtual disk includes a simple FAT-like file system. It means you can create a real folder or a file on this system just like Windows and Linux. --But you can't run an executable program on it because it just a file system simulator not a operating system simulator.
